# team-algorithm-analysis
Team project implementing Linear Search, Binary Search, Bubble Sort, and Quick Sort with runtime analysis

This project measures and compares the execution time of four fundamental algorithms using Java.  
Each team member implemented one algorithm and measured its performance for input sizes **100**, **500**, and **1000** elements.

## 🚀 Project Scope
- Weeks 1–13 (Search, Sort, Hashing, Algorithmic Complexity)
- Measures time using `System.nanoTime()`
- Displays results in table format
- Includes consolidated runner for all algorithms

## 📁 Project Structure

team-algorithm-analysis
- Member1_LinearSearch.java
- Member2_BinarySearch.java
- Member3_BubbleSort.java
- Member4_QuickSort.java
- TeamRunner.java


## 🧩 Implemented Algorithms
- **Linear Search** (Member 1) - (22UG3-0328)
- **Binary Search** (Member 2) – (22UG3-0311) 
- **Bubble Sort** (Member 3) - (22UG3-0544)
- **Quick Sort** (Member 4) - (22UG3-0347)

Each algorithm:
- Generates random arrays  
- Measures execution time  
- Prints results for input sizes 100, 500, 1000
